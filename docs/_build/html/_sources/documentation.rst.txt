Documentation
*************

In summary: The software has three main files ...

 * core.py
 * functions.py
 * params.py.

The core.py is the main file, which includes the information of the params.py and functions.py. To run the software, the user need to run the core.py file
The functions.py is a library of functions called from the core.py.
The params.py is the file containing the paths to the input data as well as other needed variables. That's the only file that the user needs to change.

The input data are given by the user in the params.py file.
The output data are:

* XXXX.py: A file with the name of the best combination is returned. Its contenten is: x1 y1 dx2 dy2 peakCorr meanAbsCorr SNratio magn angle val_magn val_angle pts_filtered

* table_results_postfilt.txt: A table with the number of discared points (in percent) from the different post-filters.

* IDMatch_parameters.txt: A table that copies the parameters set by the user in the params.py file.

* velocity_report.pdf: A report displaying the velocity field from the best combination found (best match) and summarizes the results obtained from all iterations.

Functions in IDMatch
====================

There are several functions used in IDMatch and they were built in a way that each step of the workflow (see details in :ref:`label-core`) represents one function.
For instance, one function is about image filtering, another one for image matching and another one for displaying the results.
Only in one case (the matching function) needs to call another one, mainly for the purpose of readability.

In the following, the functions a listed together with their purpose, inputs and outputs.

The core file
=============

The core file is the main file collecting the information from the parameters and the functions.

It calls the functions one after the other, starting with:

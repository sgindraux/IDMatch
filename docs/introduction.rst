Introduction
************

Image and DSM Matching (IDMatch) is a software that derives surface velocities from an image or a digital surface model (DSM) pair.

It has been mainly designed for UAV datasets but works for many kind of ortho-images.
There are many variables that influences the quality of the velocity fields. For instance, the choice of the matching method and the template size
are very important, as well as the application of post-filters to discard the wrong matches. IDMatch has many embedded options and produces several velocity fields
from one input data pair in an iterative way. The purpose is to test all combinations and to give as output the "best"  velociy field.

The software recquires the user to define...

IDMatch has been tested on three different datasets, namely an alpine glacier, a calving glacier and a rock glaciers.
An example of report generated by the software is presented below.

Example of application
======================

Here we present the results we obtained with a case study, an alpine glacier called the Griesgletscher.
Two UAV surveys were conducted on the xx and xx in 2018 and the images were processed in Agisoft PhotoScan to generate orhto-images and DSMs.

They have a resolution of xx and xx respectively for both dates.
Over x GCPs were measured during both surveys, which gave us a good confidence that the datasets are orthrectified with an accuracy of about 2cm in the xy direction.


In the parameter file (params.py) we set the paths to out datasets and filled the corresponding variables. We chose to test all implemented pre-filters and all matching methods.
We chose to run the mode 3, which will process the images as well as the DSM. After the iterative process where all images and DSMs goes through all pre-filters and matching functions,
we obtained xx different velocity fields. The velocity fields were all fieltered with the same manner and the number of discarded points per filter are recorded. The results are
displayed in Figure :ref:'_result-postfiltering'.

From this Figure, we can observe that the best result is the "IXF2M1".
The velocity field of this combination is shown in Figure :ref:'_result-velocityfield'

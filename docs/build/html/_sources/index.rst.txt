Image and DSM Matching (IDMatch) is a software that derives surface velocities from an image or a digital surface model (DSM) pair.

It has been mainly designed for UAV datasets but works for many kind of ortho-images.
There are many variables that influences the quality of the velocity fields. For instance, the choice of the matching method and the template size
are very important, as well as the application of post-filters to discard the wrong matches. IDMatch has many embedded options and produces several velocity fields
from one input data pair in an iterative way. The purpose is to test all combinations and to give as output the "best"  velociy field.

The software recquires the user to define...

IDMatch has been tested on three different datasets, namely an alpine glacier, a calving glacier and a rock glaciers.
An example of report generated by the software is shown below.
